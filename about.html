                    Unit 669 has been credited with hundreds of rescues. Some of the more high-profile missions
                    are listed below.

                    On September 15, 1997, the Shayetet 13 Naval Commandos sent an assault team to conduct a
                    raid in Lebanon. The team encountered an improvised explosive device (IED) and was ambushed
                    by Hezbollah in what has subsequently been called the Ansariya Ambush. 13 of the naval
                    commandos were killed and 3 were injured. Unit 669 responded by sending a team to evacuate
                    the injured commando team, while taking heavy enemy fire. For bravery and performance under
                    fire the 669 team received a formal citation.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">

                    In 2003, 669 rescued ten Turkish seamen when they were caught in a heavy storm in the
                    Mediterranean Sea. Under these severe weather and sea conditions, the 669 soldiers rescued
                    and evacuated the sailors from their ship at sea.

                    During the Second Lebanon War (2006) and Operation Cast Lead (2008), Unit 669 made dozens of
                    high-profile rescues of injured soldiers under enemy fire.

                    During the 2014 military campaign Protective Edge, 669 evacuated hundreds of casualties.
                    These rescues, often under fire, earned the unit a formal citation award from the Chief of
                    Staff of the IDF.</span>

                <h2>Training Courses</h2>
                <p>Due to the possibility of having to fight their way to casualties beyond enemy lines, unit
                    soldiers are highly trained in special forces tactics and become highly efficient ground
                    soldiers in addition to their high level of medical training. Their training and selection lasts
                    18 months and is considered to be among the most physically and psychologically demanding of the
                    IDF. Courses that candidates must pass include:

                    Basic training with the IDF Paratroopers
                    Special operations combat training
                    Special operations combat medics' course (select soldiers continue on<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1">to paramedics' course)
                    Advanced land warfare including jungle warfare, desert warfare, and urban warfare
                    Counter-terrorism course in the IDF Counter-Terror Warfare School
                    Scuba Diving course and Rescue Diver course
                    Rappelling and high angle rescue course
                    Advanced helicopter infiltration and exfiltration tactics
                    Rescue under harsh conditions
                    Parachuting course in the IDF Parachuting School
                    Advanced solo navigation
                    Commanders' course
                    Upon completion of their training, unit soldiers are expected to sign on for an extra 18 months
                    of service in addition to the standard three-year mandatory service. Cost of training is
                    estimated to be 1 million Israeli new shekel per individual.</span></p>

                <p>
                    A typical rescue team from 669 consists of a mix of 669 specialized warfighters and doctors. The unit itself is composed of five branches:

                    "Extraction". The "extraction" branch (Hebrew: חילוץ, Hiluz) has a company of advanced and specialized infantrymen. These soldiers have passed the 18 month 669 training regimen, and have a fundamental medical background as well as the tools to execute complicated rescues on land or at sea, in peacetime or under fire.
                    
                    "Evacuation". The "evacuation" branch (Hebrew: פינוי, Pinu'i)<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2"> has a company of airborne doctors, paramedics, and nurses. These medical personnel are critical to the mission by bringing advanced and specialized medical knowledge and experience to the injured, both in the field and in the air on the way to the hospital.
                    
                    "Training School". Combat Search and Rescue and Air Crow Survival School
                    
                    "MIA". Locating Missing In Action Combatants. Includes skilled field personnel.
                    
                    Technical support group. The largest branch, the technical support group is composed of non-combat soldiers who assist in logistics for the unit.</span>
